#### By _**Kaila Sprague McRae & Joseph Nero**_

| It will ask the user to enter two sets of coordinates between 1-8 |  |  |
| A instance of a queen class will be created featuring the first set of coordinates | 1,2 | queen.x = 1 , queen.y = 2 |
| A instance of an opp class will be created featuring the second set of coordinates | 1,2 | opp.x = 1 , opp.y = 2 |
| A instance of an opp class will be created featuring the second set of coordinates | 1,2 | opp.x = 1 , opp.y = 2 |
| if the queen has the same x or y coordinate as the opponent, return true | opp.x = 1, queen.x = 1 | true |
| if the difference between the x coordinates and the y coordinates between the queen and the opponent are equal, return true | (queen.x - opp.x) = (queen.y - opp.y) | true |
